# moq-relay

A server that connects publishing clients to subscribing clients.
SUBSCRIBE requests are deduplicated and cached, so that a single publisher can serve many subscribers.
Standalone FETCH requests always create a fresh upstream request and are never cached or deduplicated.
Relative and Absolute Joining FETCH requests are accepted from downstream clients, resolved from an active SUBSCRIBE or established PUBLISH association, and forwarded upstream as fresh Standalone FETCH requests. V1 does not forward Joining FETCH natively between hops or serve FETCH responses from the track cache.

## Usage

The publisher must choose a unique name for their broadcast, sent as the WebTransport path when connecting to the server.
Connection paths are normalized and validated: trailing slashes are trimmed, dot segments and percent-encoded characters are rejected, and empty segments are not allowed. Capitalization matters.

For example: `CONNECT https://relay.quic.video/BigBuckBunny`

The MoqTransport handshake includes a `role` parameter, which must be `publisher` or `subscriber`.
The specification allows a `both` role but you'll get an error.

You can have one publisher and any number of subscribers connected to the same path.
If the publisher disconnects, then all subscribers receive an error and will not get updates, even if a new publisher reuses the path.

## Authorization

Per-scope bearer-token authorization is supported via `ScopeConfig.auth`. When a scope has an auth policy, every accepted client session must present a valid Common Access Token (CAT, draft-ietf-moq-c4m) in the CLIENT_SETUP AUTHORIZATION TOKEN parameter. Known gap: relay-to-relay `--announce` forward links are relay-initiated and currently do not present a token; they emit a warning when connecting to an auth-enabled scope.

The `auth-cat` crate feature is off by default. Embedders that want token enforcement enable it and supply `ScopeAuthConfig` through `Coordinator::get_scope_config`. The enforcement model and fail-closed contract are documented in `src/auth/mod.rs`.

**FETCH grant.** Standalone FETCH requires the CAT `moqt` claim to include a `Fetch(7)` scope covering the requested namespace and track. During the v0.1 transition period, a token that grants only `Subscribe(4)` and has no `Fetch(7)` entry at all is also accepted (the relay logs this at debug level). Once all token issuers have been updated to include `Fetch(7)`, the fallback will be removed. A token that explicitly grants `Fetch(7)` for a different track is not upgraded via Subscribe fallback; issuer scope intent is honoured.
