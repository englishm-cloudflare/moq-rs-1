# Changelog
All notable changes to this project will be documented in this file.

The format is based on [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.0.0/),
and this project adheres to [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html).

## [Unreleased]

### Changed

- *(auth)* FETCH now checks `Fetch(7)` (CAT `moqt` action) before `Subscribe(4)`.
  Tokens with an explicit `Fetch(7)` scope are no longer permitted to fall back
  to `Subscribe(4)` for tracks their `Fetch(7)` scope excludes.

- *(auth)* New `DenyReason::ActionAbsent` replaces `ScopeMismatch` when the
  token contains no grant for the requested action type at all (vs. has a grant
  but the namespace/track predicate does not match).  **Dashboard owners**: the
  `deny_reason` log field and the `action_absent` metric label will appear for
  denials that were previously labelled `scope_mismatch`.  The wire error code
  is unchanged (UNAUTHORIZED).

### Added

- *(auth)* `Subscribe(4)` backward-compatibility fallback: tokens issued before
  `Fetch(7)` was a distinct CAT action and carrying only `Subscribe(4)` are
  still accepted for FETCH during the v0.1 transition period (signalled by
  `DenyReason::ActionAbsent`).  The fallback is logged at debug level and
  isolated for removal once all pilots emit `Fetch(7)`.  It does **not** apply
  when a `Fetch(7)` scope is present but excludes the requested track.
